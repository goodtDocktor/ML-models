Classification & Regression PJs

Welcome to my ML-models folder! This repository is a collection of machine learning projects focusing on both classification and regression tasks. Here, you'll find a variety of projects that demonstrate the application of different algorithms to solve real-world problems.

Happy exploring! :)

# Project Outlines
**1. _presidential-election-decision-trees:_** 
For a presidential election, campaign organizers for both the Republican and Democrat parties are interested in identifying undecided voters who would consider voting for their party. This project uses BlueOrRed.csv which contains data on a sample of voters with tracked variables including: whether or not they are undecided regarding their candidate preference, age, whether they own a home, gender, marital status, household size, income, years of education, and whether they attend church. For this dataset, I will use the Undecided variable as my output variable and the rest of the variables as my input variables. I want to predict whether a candidate is undecided(Undecided=1) or decided(Undecided=0).

**2. _customer-churn:_**
Research Question: Can we predict whether a customer will churn (cancel their subscription) or not based on their usage behavior and demographics using Decision Trees and Random Forest classifiers?
This project uses the “digits” dataset from sklearn & the answer to the RQ is discussed at the end.

**3. _knn-implentation-and-comparisons:_**
This project has two-parts:
_Part I_ - implements K-NN from scratch as well as uses tools built into sklearn. This section of the project uses the resulting K-NN algorithms to compare to other algorithms.
_Part II_ - uses the dataset forestfires.csv to predict the extent of burned area in forest fires based on the given weather and enviromental attributes. The answer to the RQ is discussed at the end.
